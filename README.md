# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains client libraries for the Google Consumer Surveys API, built by the Consumer Surveys team @ Google. Please note that these libraries are not officially supported by Google. They are provided as a convenience to users who want to get up and running quickly and would prefer not to use the REST end-points documented @ developers.google.com/consumer-surveys as they build proofs of concepts. The Consumer Surveys team will do their best to keep the libraries up-to-date as the API evolves, but it's possible that at any given point they stop working. For this reason please treat them as illustrative only. Should you want to launch a production-quality service on the API please use the REST end-points directly.
